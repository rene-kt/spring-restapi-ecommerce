## How to use :wave: (IF YOU WANT TO USE IT LOCALLY) 

To clone and run this application by yourself, make sure you have at least Java 8 and all JDK stuff (including JRE), Maven to build the dependencies,
Ecplise or STS, and Postman (it's not necessary, though it's really useful to handle a rest API. After that, do the following instructions

- Switch the branch to ```running-locally```

- Clone this repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/reness0/spring-restapi-ecommerce
```
- Open this project using Eclipse or Spring tool Suit

- Run ```EcommerceApplication.java```
  > This is gonna be building the maven dependencies too

- The endpoints are located in 'http://localhost:3000/ecommerce' and config its port on ```src/main/resources/application.properties```
  > Use a software like postman to do the resquests. 
  
- Make sure to create a database called **ecommerce** 
  > or create it with another name. However, you must to rename its name in ```src/main/resources/application.properties```

 **By the way, you can change the port (3000) to another one, just change the line in ```src/main/resources/application.properties```**

  **Now, you are able to run this Java application locally.** :heavy_check_mark:


## If you only want to use the API without cloning the project
